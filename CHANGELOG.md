# v2.0.0

 - Added [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) doc
 - Now you must first run `logbt --setup` with root privileges to setup the core_pattern
   - The `--setup` command sets a core_pattern of `/tmp/logbt-coredump/core.%p`
 - Now `logbt` does not need to run as root after `logbt --setup`
   - When run as non-root, the core_pattern of `/tmp/logbt-coredump/core.%p` is expected
 - Added `logbt --test` command to ensure backtraces are working
 - Refactored internal code to avoid mutable global variables

# v1.6.0

 - Fixed handling of non-tracked cores on linux (from crashing "grandchildren")

# v1.5.0

 - Fixed edge case in parsing corefile path on linux (when an extra `.` occurred in path to the binary)

# v1.4.0

 - Fixed support for lauching bash scripts with `logbt`. Previously only native programs were supported

# v1.3.0

 - Now displays backtraces for all likely descendant processes. This means that
   a backtrace will be displayed for "grandchildren" children of the
   program that `logbt` launches as well as the direct child.
 - Now warns at startup if existing corefiles are detected

# v1.2.0

 - Add support for when multiple programs crash by tracking pid of the child program
 - Added unit tests
 - Added sudo/sudoless support
 - Added support for both linux and osx

# v1.1.0

 - Now will print backtrace for any crash that generates a corefile (not just SIGSEGV)
 - Sets a core_pattern of `/tmp/logbt-coredump/core.%p` at startup

# v1.0.0

 - First release.
 - Sets a core_pattern of `/tmp/logbt-coredump` at startup
 - Must be run as root/sudo
 - Only prints backtrace when exit code of program is `139` (aka SIGSEGV/segfaults).
    - Will not work for aborts (SIGABRT), illegal instructions (SIGILL), floating point errors (SIGFPE), bus errors (SIGBUS), or other causes of C/C++ crashes.
 - Only prints backtrace for one corefile. If multiple processes crash behavior is undefined.
